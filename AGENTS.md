# Agent Instructions

- This repository is focused exclusively on the torch example located in `examples/torch`.
- When validating changes, building the `llama-torch-example` target is sufficient; no additional tests are required.
- Use `-j 8` when invoking `cmake --build` so the build runs with reasonable parallelism.
